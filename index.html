                <p>We had a lot of issues and barriers to overcome as a team after three months of working together on this project. Nonetheless, we managed to accomplish our assignment. Early, our team did not manage time properly at the start of this project, therefore we have to devote 100% of our time and effort to completing some of the first phases of the project as quickly as possible to ensure that we do not postpone the other stages of the project. Second, when we performed this project, we didn't know how to code in HTML, CSS, or Javascript. As a result, in addition to the time allotted for this project, our team will need to spend extra time learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and Javascript to ensure that we have enough skills to construct a working website that fits the requirements for this assignment. Third, we were rarely solicited for guidance and did everything on our own. As a result, our team continually encouraged each other to be more confident and to strive to get our shell to reach more people, as well as our instructor to provide more guidance. Our teams, on the other hand, did not have any disputes while we worked together because we always respected and examined other people's points of view before choosing what was best for the group to achieve the goal of our project that we set. Furthermore, the team members were responsible and supportive; they always completed the task for which they were accountable, and we also encouraged each other to address our deficiencies to make the project as wonderful as possible. Furthermore, if someone in the team was having difficulties with the project, we would be eager to assist our teammates in any way we could, which is rather crucial. Furthermore, by working on this project, we will be able to learn more about the IT sector. First, we discovered that an IT project needs extensive participation from several areas and professions such as UI/UX design, Project Manager, Fronted - Designer, and so on. We also learned more about several fascinating sectors of the industry, such as machine learning and artificial intelligence. Non-technical skills, such as soft skills, were also crucial aspects that we discovered throughout this research. We understood how to organize the procedure and manage our time to fulfill the deadline for this task. We used our critical thinking and creativity skills to come up with the idea for this project.</p>

        <div class="max-width">
            <h2 class="title">Team Profile</h2>
            <div class="profile-content">
                <p>For each individual:</p>
                <p>•	Cuong: My dream future employment would be as a Back-End Developer, preferably in an AI platform. I was fascinated by the uses of AI technology, and I'm curious about how those AI systems function and why they're so smart. OpenAI just released Chat GPT, which uses an AI bot to assist consumers to solve their problems quite successfully. AI is the future of technology in my opinion, and I would want to design an AI system in the future.</p>
                <p>•	Loc: I am passionate about working with Data. I think it would be interesting if I could evaluate a bunch of data and create an efficient strategy for the marketing office. Data analytics would be an ideal job for my future career.</p>
                <p>•	Nguyen: In the future, I hope to work on an IT project that helps companies to reduce the amount of time of developing and operating a typical IT product. Therefore, I think I going to pursue a career as a DevOps Engineer.</p>
                <p>•	Long: I like to manage or manage something, but it's not business or human resources, it's information. I always want to support, provide information or run an individual or an organization. Or better yet, help my career path in the future. So I think it will be right for me to choose to study and learn about information management systems (MIS) and become a good engineer in this field.</p>
                <p>Summary:</p>
                <p>•	Similarities: From the above, it can be seen that almost all members of the group have something in common in their vision of their future careers. That is, they all tend to want to work more on the Back-end than the Front-end. For example, they all talked about wanting to be involved in the development of core operations, evaluating data analytics and strategies, and directly intervening to reduce the time for IT products in the process. operations, and manage the amount of information for any business or project, large or small. Moreover, ideally, all members want to bring technology to life or certain fields, as well as want to participate in the development of technology soon.</p>
                <p>•	Differences: On the other hand, there are also differences between group members. To talk about the difference it is necessary to go into a little more detail. Those are the specific types of majors in IT, as Cuong is very interested in AI (Artificial Intelligence), Loc and Nguyen are interested in data research, strategy, development, and operations, and Long wants to manage information for certain business organizations or projects. The arrays above all produce a different amount of work; Knowledge, experience, and job pressure are also different.</p>

Along with that, the game is gradually being used by many users, regardless of whether they are young or old, they are gradually approaching the game. A website is therefore an essential tool for everyone. As for us - the members of this project team also have a purpose when designing this website based on artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The reason is that we are all interested in this type of technology, and want to learn and access it more. And this is our chance to do just that. From the above reasons, we see that this is a project that directly contributes to helping each team member have more knowledge and skills in the future learning and working process.</li>

We discovered two system constraints after creating the prototype procedure. First, we could not apply the AI system to the website due to a lack of expertise in AI, and the second constraint was regarding the database, which is an impossible undertaking because we had only learned the front end. Our result is still simple; there are superficial viewing options for visitors, and therefore no known bugs have been discovered. In contrast, when we develop an actual website based on this concept, issues may occur when more complicated features are introduced at this early stage, we just try to anticipate any bugs.</li>

After completing Data and AI in the second year, the two limitations related to a lack of expertise will be addressed. We will achieve maximum productivity working as a team in the last year since we will study project management skills and complete the website at this point. </li>

                        <p>After working with each other for 3 months, I have gained a huge amount of knowledge and experience, although there is something that our team should have improved. On the one hand, we had made many mistakes such as had not checked the timetable section in the project proposal carefully, not asking for advice and feedback from the lecturer frequently to complete the project successfully and especially rarely finishing tasks before the deadline that we set for ourselves, but the good point is that we could figure out our problems and tried to fix them. On the other hand, there were many amazing things that we could made during the project process. We worked together and created many creative ideas for the project. We also knew how to make a professional project proposal, which positions a project's needs, and how to make an impressive presentation to potential investors. Furthermore, we were trying to research many IT fields including web programming, machine learning, AI, and other non-technical platforms such as analyzing the product’s market, predicting the risks of each project’s section, and finding the way how to solve them. As a leader, I also had an opportunity to improve my organizing skills by listing tasks, assigning those to every member, setting the deadlines and timetable for each section, and supporting our members as much as I can with their tasks. In my opinion, this project helps me and also our team to develop a lot of essential skills and gain more experience to develop our careers.</p>

                        <p>One thing that fortunately happened well in this project is that we were very convenient in assigning work to team members with only 1.2 online meetings. The things that have improved during the past work are probably the new spirit and source of knowledge that I have gained when applying AI technology to the website. Moreover, one thing that surprised me was the seriousness and dedication to the work of the rest of the team members, it made me unconsciously have to be more serious. Since then, the new project is implemented early, has time to adjust as well as create the most complete product. That's what surprised me the most and also the lesson I learned from my partners.</p>

                        <p>I think this is a very wonderful group as we near the end of the assignment time. We always completed the job prior to the deadline, and if somebody didn't grasp something, someone in the group was always ready to lend a hand. I believe this was made possible by the same mindsets in my group. In my opinion, everyone in the group seemed to be highly enthusiastic about IT and in charge of the group project. As far as I can tell, whether the sessions were in person or online, our group often arrived a little late. Productivity may rise if this issue could be reduced. After every incident in our lives, we learn a new lesson. Since this is my first group at university, after observing my teammate at work, I have gained timing skills, and a better understanding of proper task allocation, and I know when to speak out in meetings. The task was a particular aspect that struck me. Although I believe the lecture gave us a great effective project that required us to use a variety of abilities to complete, I found it to be a little too demanding owing to the little amount of time.</p>

                        <p>After working with our team on this project, we actually have an amazing time together in a very major way. Team members really were really supportive and responsible, and we always actually told each sort of other to for all intents and purposes finish our work as soon as possible, Moreover, the teams also gave advice and really bring a definitely positive attitude to all of the members. If someone on the team had any struggles on the project, we would definitely be willing to essentially help our teams mate as kind of possible as we could, which literally is fairly significant. We, as a team, also definitely help each other to improve the HTML, CSS, and Javascript generally skill that basically are going to really help us in our future careers in a generally major way. After this project, I have learned a lot of things, I know how to organize things in an effective way. Time management is also a skill that I have achieved after working with all of my teammates. Moreover, I, as an IT student, also aim a lot of HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills for myself, I think these skills are the most important and really essential for my future career path.</p>

Cuong had already become accustomed to Github, Python, HTML, and CSS, due to his work using these applications to create the Flappy Bird game with his team. Loc had already built a website while taking the front-end course "F8" so he was familiar with HTML and CSS on a fundamental level. Nguyen has experience in designing because he had done a lot of design projects before so he is very suitable to design the user interface.

                        <p>We can just design and produce the homepage and a few features for this website right now due to our limited relevant skills, but we feel that once done, it will be a very productive tool for everyone. This website is extremely useful because it saves users time when searching for a game, creates a perfect connection between game developers and players, makes useful recommendations about how much time our users should spend playing those games, and reduces harmful information by selecting games collectively.</p>

                    <p>Our team picked this issue since we saw that people's desire for amusement is growing by the day. Most of us have spent hours looking for a game that matches our interests and the amount of time we have to spend playing games, but we still cannot find the game we desire. Our team members are also game consumers, and we understand how difficult it is to discover acceptable games, therefore we want to establish a website that will assist the community in selecting the game that will satisfy them. Another reason is that most of us are planning to learn web programming in the coming semester, so creating a professional website for this project is a great opportunity for us to practice and develop our skills before learning that course.</p>

                    <p class="first">There are numerous of websites that help users to find games but there were only a few websites that recommended users with games which is suitable for their enthusiasm and daily routine, but none of which were applying AI technology. I had spent hours on researching game webistes and I divided those into 3 main types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Game review and news website: These websites provide game reviews, previews, and news. They frequently have a huge editorial staff that plays and writes about a diverse range of games. IGN, GameSpot, and Polygon are a few examples.</li>
                        <li>Game distribution platforms: Users may buy and download games from these websites. They may also include elements like forums, social networking, and achievements. Steam, GOG, and the Epic Games Store are a few examples.</li>
                        <li>Game discovery platforms: These websites assist consumers in discovering new games that match their hobbies or tastes. They may propose games based on a user's play history or ratings, or they may allow users to explore games by genre, topic, or other criteria. itch.io and Humble Bundle are two examples.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="second">Our team had dicuss and together decided to choose which features of those websites are necessary for our website. We tried to apply some similar functions such as game recommendations, page to select types of game, forums,… However, the most special and unique feature that is only in our website is game recommendations by AI technology, which help users exploring the suitable games for them more flexibly and accurately.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>It is quite complicated to implement, apply and develop (improve, improve) an AI program based on user needs. (Quality) It can be mentioned that the ability to use the tools of the group is not thorough and professional (in-depth).</li>
                            <li>AI development can use a variety of popular languages such as python, Java, C++, etc. Python was accessible early (first). The problem lies in two types of programming languages, Java and C++, because they have not had much access to these two types, so synthesizing and condensing it for use in the AI development process for the project will cost a lot. time.</li>
                            <li>Devices: There is a possibility that some devices (in particular laptops) are overloaded during operation, having to process large amounts of data. The point here is when creating AI and running the program continuously to check the accuracy and errors will be encountered.</li>
                            <li>The selection of tools for AI programming such as VScode, Eclipse IDE, Xcode (MacOS only), Pycharm, NotePad++, ATOM, etc; It's also a small problem that we have encountered because each tool has a different pros and cons.</li>
                            <li>The basic thing to implement AI creation is to learn about algorithmic solutions, especially to understand and apply Machine Learning to AI programs. Machine Learning is an important branch of the field of AI, it is a field of study that allows computers to have the ability to improve themselves based on training data or on experience (what has been learned). learn). Machine learning can predict or make decisions on its own without being specifically programmed. To understand Machine Learning, we had a hard time learning about Workflow steps like Dataset, Preprocessing, Training model, Evaluating model, and Improve. Besides, it is most necessary to choose the classifications of Machine Learning such as Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning. It is quite difficult for us to learn and effectively apply the above concepts.</li>

                        <p>Website interface is also one of the difficult problems, which requires us to master 3 types of programming languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Moreover, we also have to be familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Backbone, AngularJS, and EmberJS to ensure the content is always displayed well on all different devices; or using the jQuery and LESS libraries. This took a lot of time for our team, as we had to directly gather a large amount of experience with the things I mentioned above during the project itself.</p>
                        <p>Advertising is also a part of the problem that the interface design department has to deal with, receiving ads to maintain the project is inevitable, but if too many ads also appear simultaneously on the website interface, it will make users feel uncomfortable when experiencing our project.</p>
                        <p>We had to consider 2 options to handle this problem:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Only receive a certain number of ads so that those ads appear on the website in a limited way and are within the calculation of the interface design department.</li>
                                <li>There is no limit to the number of ads that will appear on the interface of the website, but the design department will have to shoulder a large amount of work in designing and calculating the arrangement so that it does not interfere. customer usage experience.</li>

                    In the first 2 weeks, we spent time forming a group and getting objective ideas for our project. All members met and agreed to work together on a project, namely to create a game consulting website and use AI technology as a foundation. The group includes Cuong, Loc, Nguyen, and Long. On Tuesday, our team scheduled a face-to-face meeting to discuss the project topic for 3 hours. In the next 2 days, our task was to research the basic concepts of AI. This requires all members to be able to synthesize information as quickly and efficiently as possible for the project. But more specifically, Nguyen and Long researched how to build a website (on Google & Microsoft Edge); Cuong and Loc researched general game topics (on Google Play & App Store). We create an online meeting on Friday and finished learning about AI to build a website and find the game’s topics.

Besides, the whole group completed the necessary things to submit the early draft to the lecturer. This helped the team get feedback from the lecturer to improve our project. On Wednesday, the team leader created a document page on Google Docs so that members can work on the project together and prepare ideas from the provided rubric and sample. The next day, We identified the topic, scope, aim, communication methods, and risks, and assigned work to each member. The deadline has been set by the team leader and all team members have agreed to complete the work lists assigned by the leader. Finally, double-check and submit the project proposal before 23:59 Sunday (13/11).

Then, in order to get agreement on the following assignment's preparation, our leader called a face-to-face meeting. However, the problem we got was a lack of knowledge relative to coding. Then, We believe that 3 weeks of fluently using HTML, CSS, and GitHub could solve this problem; moreover, if having enough knowledge and technique, Javascript is an additional suggestion. We would develop and produce an actual prototype from weeks nine to twelve.

The first four days of this week were devoted primarily to HTML, The information dealt with how to utilize a live server and was associated with some common tags such as h1 , input , p, etc. Then we had two days to create a simple website and upload it to GitHub independently. By doing this, we were able to demonstrate to the team how the study process was progressing while also developing our HTML and GitHub skills.

                    After establishing our HTML proficiency in week 7, we switched to CSS. After learning CSS for four days, we used the same approach as the previous week. We utilized the remainder of week 7 to add CSS to the HTML that we had already published to GitHub. After that, we held an online conference to assist each other in resolving issues like "how to center this div." and “how flexbox is distinct from one another?" After talking over these issues, we came up with several answers: Display: flex right: 50 transform: translateX(-50%) was the answer to the first query, and "flexbox would show a high performance with single div and grid operate efficiently with multi div" was the response to the second. The most effective technique to center a div is using a flexbox since just the item was moved when the solution was given, making it appear as though the div was not actually in the center. You must translate X (-50%) to center the object. We considered this to be a really advantageous technique as it helps us to improve our capacity to clone code from GitHub and raise the effectiveness of our cooperation.

                    The prototype will be made in the next four weeks, therefore this is the last week for us to rehearse. A little project was a really helpful way for us to put everything we had learned into practice. Within a week, we created a little project, reviewed it, and provided comments to all the participants so they could improve it for the larger project. On the first day, we planned to spend two hours discussing how we would divide up the work over the next six days. One issue we had was a lack of ideas; we spent too much time on this and had no clue what we were doing or how our website's user interface should appear. Thus, we made the decision to construct a website that provides details about many animals. We structured our website's interface into four segments since our three main animal subjects were cats, dogs, and horses. The header was the first component, and Cuong was in charge of it since he wanted to integrate Javascript functionality that would allow him to transition between a bright and dark mode for the visitors' convenience. The second portion was made by Loc since he loves cats, Nguyen made the dog part, and Long made the horse part. After 5 days for this part, we had an online meeting for giving feedback and answering any questions among us.

On Tuesday, we held an online meeting to list all of the tasks that we need to do before the end of the semester and allocate them to each member. We finished many sections of the report after working very hard for four days, such as personal information, career plan, topic description, motivation, landscape, aims, roles, tools and technologies, testing, risks, and communication, but there were still many mistakes in testing, communication, tools and technologies, and many tasks that had not been completed. We all decided over the weekend that we should take a two-day vacation to rest and celebrate the new year with our families, so we postponed the procedure until next week.

Each member was allocated a piece of the report, and we needed to finish it by the following week. From Wednesday through Sunday, we concentrated on completing things that required more than one person and attended school every day except Sunday to do so. Cuong and Loc were in charge of developing the website for our report, while Nguyen and Long were in charge of creating the prototype. After completing the prototype, we collaborated to create the presentation slide as well as the Scope and Limits and Project Outcomes sections of the report.

                        We built all the features of the homepage that we had described in the scope section, including “Home”, “Find your games”, “Types of games”, “Top Charts”, and “Support”. When users scroll down the homepage, they will see a short description of each feature, which helps them to understand it more clearly.

                        We have applied some example questions to our prototype website, which help us to analyze and define the personality and daily habits of the customers. We changed our form of a question from multiple choice questions to normal-typing questions so that we might receive more detailed and precise answers from users and develop our recommendation system to be more accurate.

                        We also completed all of the work for the 'Types Of Games' section, as well as the list of games by category. There are several gaming genres, including action, adventure, strategy, sport, and so on. Each game category will show some suggested games, and each game will include a brief description beneath its image.

                        On the “Top Charts” page, users can discover the leaderboards of many game types. For example, “League of Legends” is the game have the most users are playing and also receive the highest rating from the game community in the action game. The second one is “God of War: Ragnarok” and the third one is GTA V. There are also many other game types that users can explore.

                        We could not apply AI technology due to the lack of time available to research deeper about AI technology or machine learning. To be honest, we have no experience in this area. Most of the time we had used in this project was studying how to code HTML, CSS, and Javascript. We tried our best to design an example of how our users will be suggested a suitable game by our system. This page includes our suggested game, the percentage of how it suits our users, the rating, the developer, a brief description, and a short tutorial video of that game as a background. If the users want to know more details about that game, they can click on the “Find Out More” button. They can also click on the “Next Game” button if they want to explore a new game.
